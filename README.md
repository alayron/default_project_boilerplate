# Default Project Boilerplate [working title]

The Default Project Boilerplate's pourpose is it, to provide a fast and easy to use boilerplate for getting a project started. This is however a *compass project* and uses *scss features*. It will not fullfill its meaning without an offline workflow. I used the *Html5 Boilerplate Project* as a basis to develop this boilerplate. Feel free to use it, modify and change it in any way you want. Create an issue or get into contact with my any other way, if you feel like there is something missing / done wrong in this project.
